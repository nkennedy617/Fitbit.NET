This document is intended to help with the initial build of the Fitbit.Net Visual Studio project.

Prerequisites:
(Obvious development tools)
Visual Studio (different versions work)
SQL Server Express / SQL Server
IIS server installation


(Package manager)
Nuget (a package manager for Visual Studio)
see https://www.nuget.org/
--This will need to be installed and Visual Studio restarted, prior to starting work with Fitbit
code.
--Nuget may also require a specific version of the .Net Framework.



(Fitbit dev)
The Fitbit developer accounts requires a few changes.
